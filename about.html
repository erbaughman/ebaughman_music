      <h1>Clay Cook</h1>
      <p>Hello, Internet. This is awkward so I'll make it quick.
      I was born on April 20th, 1978 (send cash, not presents) in Atlanta, GA. Had a relatively simple, suburban upbringing. My interest in music was a little out of the ordinary for most 5 year olds. I was actually PLAYING guitar by 7. While everyone else was playing video games, I was practicing scale fingers & chord changes. I am still good at Tecmo Bowl though.</p>

      <h1>John Driskell Hopkins</h1>
      <p>Howdy, folks. John Driskell Hopkins here. I was born in San Antonio, Texas on May 3, 1971 at Lackland AFB and I was raised in Gainesville, GA. (Go Big Red) I have been singing since I could talk. Like a lot of us who grew up in the South, my earliest musical experiences were in the church choir. Choir was a great place to gain a real understanding of vocal harmony and musical structure. In fifth grade, I started piano lessons and began to learn about music theory in it's simplest forms.</p>

      <h1>Jimmy De Martini</h1>
      <p>Music has been a part of my life as long as I can remember. While my parents didn’t play any instruments, they would always have music playing around the house and anytime we were in the car. The Police, Led Zeppelin, Paul Simon, The Beatles, Grateful Dead, Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers, and many more were all shaping my musical taste from an early age. My interest in performing music didn’t begin until around the age of twelve.</p>

      <h1>Chris Fryar</h1>
      <p>I hit things! That's what I do. I guess it makes me one of the most laid-back people I know. I suggest you try it...hitting drums, that is! When you see me onstage with a smile on my face, it's because I LOVE what I do. I was born in November of 1970, and according to my mom, I was an easy-going, laid-back, happy child. She also claims that I was singing and banging on pots and pans at a very early age...but I don't really remember any of that.</p>

      <h1>Matt Mangano</h1>
      <p>Hello everyone. My name is Matt Mangano and I play the bass. I'm honored to be the newest member of Zac Brown Band. In 2008, Zac and I reconnected when he asked me to help him work on the three records that would be the foundation of Southern Ground Artists. That job led to a full-time position working for SGA, recording and producing music. In early 2012, I helped Zac with the founding of Southern Ground Nashville, one of Nashville's finest recording facilities.</p>

      <h1>Daniel De Los Reyes</h1>
      <p>Where to start...I have been playing drum set and percussion instruments as far back as I can remember. I think I was probably banging inside my mother's womb until she could stand it no more and said "you're out of there" like an umpire in a baseball game. But on a serious note, from the day I was born I heard many different styles and rhythms of music due to the love my parents have for music. My mother is Puerto Rican/American and my father is Cuban/American.</p>

      <h1>Coy Bowles</h1>
      <p>When I was a kid, I had a room that was next to my bedroom at my parent’s house. Actually, it was part of the attic. It was my world and secret passageway into music and all things creative and awesome. The walls were filled with photos of my favorite bands, musicians, and skateboarders that had been ripped out of magazines and stuck to the wall with thumbtacks and Scotch tape. There was a hammock in this musical, isolation chamber that was filled with sleeping bags and old pillows. </p>
